    "1. It is not trivial to recover the raw merges from the GPT-4 tokenizer. You can easily recover what we call `vocab` here, and what they call and store under `enc._mergeable_ranks`. Feel free to copy paste the `recover_merges` function in `minbpe/gpt4.py`, which takes these ranks and returns the raw merges. If you wish to know how this function works, read [this](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/issues/60) and [this](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe/issues/11#issuecomment-1950805306). Basically, under some conditions it is enough to only store the parent nodes (and their rank) and get rid of the precise details of which children merged up to any parent.\n",
    "2. Second, the GPT-4 tokenizer for some reason permutes its raw bytes. It stores this permutation in the first 256 elements of the mergeable ranks, so you can recover this byte shuffle relatively simply as `byte_shuffle = {i: enc._mergeable_ranks[bytes([i])] for i in range(256)}`. In both your encode and decode, you'll have to shuffle bytes around accordingly. If you're stuck, reference the minbpe/gpt4.py` file for hints.\n"

    "If you've made it this far, you're now a pro at LLM Tokenization! Sadly, you're not exactly done yet because a lot of LLMs outside of OpenAI (e.g. Llama, Mistral) use [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) instead. Primary difference being that sentencepiece runs BPE directly on Unicode code points instead of on UTF-8 encoded bytes. Feel free to explore sentencepiece on your own (good luck, it's not too pretty), and stretch goal if you really experience and suffer from the burden of time, re-write your BPE to be on Unicode code points and match the Llama 2 tokenizer."
